## Live Demo
**API:** https://YOUR_RAILWAY_URL  
**Web:** https://YOUR_VERCEL_URL

## The Problem
Malaysian university students find hackathon teammates via unstructured 
Discord posts with no skill filtering, no role matching, and no status 
visibility. HackMatch replaces that with structured profiles and a 
filtered participant feed.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Runtime | Node.js + Express | Familiar, performant, large ecosystem |
| Language | TypeScript | Type safety, better DX, required by target companies |
| ORM | Prisma | Type-safe queries, clean migrations, great DX |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Relational data, strong constraints, ACID |
| Auth | JWT + refresh token rotation | Stateless, secure, industry standard |
| Validation | Zod | Runtime type safety, pairs well with TypeScript |
| Logging | Winston | Structured logs, queryable in production |
| Testing | Jest + Supertest | Integration tests against real routes |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Auto-test on push, auto-deploy on merge |
| Frontend | React + TypeScript + Zustand | Component model, typed state management |
| Deployment | Railway + Render + Vercel | Free tier, zero config, fast deploys |
