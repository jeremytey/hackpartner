## The Problem

At KitaHack 2026, 50+ students posted in a single Discord channel looking for hackathon teammates: unstructured introduction messages, no filtering by role or skill, no way to know who was still available. Most teams formation was rushed last minute. 

HackPartner gives students structured profiles and a filterable participant feed for each hackathon to find the right teammate in minutes.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|-------|-----------|-----|
| Runtime | Node.js + Express | Non-blocking I/O suits concurrent API requests; lightweight enough for a single-service MVP |
| Language | TypeScript | Catches type errors at compile time across the entire codebase; `z.infer<>` gives one source of truth between Zod schemas and TS types |
| ORM | Prisma | Schema-as-code migrations prevent dev/prod drift (schema.prisma single source); typed queries eliminate a class of runtime errors that raw SQL misses at compile time |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Relational model fits the many-to-many user-skill and user-hackathon relationships; strong constraints enforce data integrity at the DB layer |
| Auth | JWT + refresh token rotation | Stateless access tokens scale horizontally; rotation means a stolen refresh token is invalidated on first reuse — attacker loses access on next rotation cycle |
| Validation | Zod | Runtime validation at the API boundary; ensures bad data never reaches Service layer; `z.infer<>` means one schema drives both runtime checks and TypeScript types |
| Logging | Winston | Structured JSON logs in production are queryable in log aggregators; `console.log` is not |
| Testing | Jest + Supertest | Integration tests hit real Express routes against a real test DB — catches middleware and auth bugs that unit tests miss |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | Test gate on every push; auto-deploy on merge to main — no broken code reaches Railway without passing the suite first |
| Frontend | React + TypeScript + Zustand | Component model with typed global auth state; Axios interceptors handle silent token refresh without user facing disruption |
| Deployment | Railway + Render + Vercel | API on Railway, DB on Render, frontend on Vercel — each service on the tier optimised for its workload |

## Testing

```bash
cd backend
npm test
```

37 integration tests across 4 suites covering: register, login, refresh token rotation, logout, profile CRUD, hackathon CRUD, join/status/leave, participant feed filtering, and edge cases (duplicate registration, expired deadlines, role-based access control, invalid tokens).
